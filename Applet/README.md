# JavaCardKeymaster Applet

This directory contains the implementation of the Keymaster 4.1
interface, in the form of a JavaCard 3.1 applet which runs in a secure
element.  It must be deployed in conjuction with the associated HAL,
which serves to intermediate between Android Keystore and this applet.
